Welcome to the repository for my traffic accident data analysis project, completed during my data science internship at Prodigy Infotech. This project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and deriving insights from a dataset containing traffic accident records.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze traffic accident data to understand patterns and trends, identify accident hotspots, and provide actionable insights that can help in enhancing road safety measures.

Data Description
The dataset used in this analysis contains the following attributes:

Attribute	Description
ID	This is a unique identifier of the accident record.
Severity	Shows the severity of the accident, a number between 1 and 4, where 1 indicates the least impact and 4 indicates the most significant impact on traffic.
Start_Time	Shows start time of the accident in local time zone.
End_Time	Shows end time of the accident in local time zone.
Start_Lat	Shows latitude in GPS coordinate of the start point.
Start_Lng	Shows longitude in GPS coordinate of the start point.
End_Lat	Shows latitude in GPS coordinate of the end point.
End_Lng	Shows longitude in GPS coordinate of the end point.
Distance(mi)	The length of the road extent affected by the accident.
Description	Shows natural language description of the accident.
Number	Shows the street number in the address field.
Street	Shows the street name in the address field.
Side	Shows the relative side of the street (Right/Left) in address field.
City	Shows the city in the address field.
County	Shows the county in the address field.
State	Shows the state in the address field.
Zipcode	Shows the zipcode in the address field.
Country	Shows the country in the address field.
Timezone	Shows timezone based on the location of the accident (eastern, central, etc.).
Airport_Code	Denotes an airport-based weather station which is the closest one to the location of the accident.
Weather_Timestamp	Shows the time-stamp of the weather observation record (in local time).
Temperature(F)	Shows the temperature (in Fahrenheit).
Wind_Chill(F)	Shows the wind chill (in Fahrenheit).
Humidity(%)	Shows the humidity (in percentage).
Pressure(in)	Shows the air pressure (in inches).
Visibility(mi)	Shows visibility (in miles).
Wind_Direction	Shows wind direction.
Wind_Speed(mph)	Shows wind speed (in miles per hour).
Precipitation(in)	Shows precipitation amount in inches, if any.
Weather_Condition	Shows the weather condition (rain, snow, thunderstorm, fog, etc.).
Amenity	A POI annotation indicating the presence of an amenity in a nearby location.
Bump	A POI annotation indicating the presence of a speed bump or hump in a nearby location.
Crossing	A POI annotation indicating the presence of a crossing in a nearby location.
Give_Way	A POI annotation indicating the presence of a give_way in a nearby location.
Junction	A POI annotation indicating the presence of a junction in a nearby location.
No_Exit	A POI annotation indicating the presence of a no_exit in a nearby location.
Railway	A POI annotation indicating the presence of a railway in a nearby location.
Roundabout	A POI annotation indicating the presence of a roundabout in a nearby location.
Station	A POI annotation indicating the presence of a station in a nearby location.
Stop	A POI annotation indicating the presence of a stop in a nearby location.
Traffic_Calming	A POI annotation indicating the presence of traffic calming measures in a nearby location.
Traffic_Signal	A POI annotation indicating the presence of a traffic signal in a nearby location.
Turning_Loop	A POI annotation indicating the presence of a turning loop in a nearby location.
Sunrise_Sunset	Shows the period of day (i.e. day or night) based on sunrise/sunset.
Civil_Twilight	Shows the period of day (i.e. day or night) based on civil twilight.
Nautical_Twilight	Shows the period of day (i.e. day or night) based on nautical twilight.
Astronomical_Twilight	Shows the period of day (i.e. day or night) based on astronomical twilight.
Methodology
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, converted data types, and ensured consistency across the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the distribution and relationships of key variables to uncover patterns and insights.
Visualization: Created various plots and charts to visually represent the data and findings.
Key Findings
City-wise Distribution: Miami is the city with the most number of accidents, while Star Junction and Stromsburg have the least.
State-wise Distribution: California has the highest number of accidents, whereas South Dakota has the least.
Yearly Trends: The year 2021 saw the highest number of accidents.
Severity Levels: Most accidents were classified at severity level 2.
Weather Conditions: The majority of accidents occurred under fair weather conditions.
Time of Day: Most accidents happened in the morning.
Conclusion
This analysis highlights key patterns in traffic accident data, such as high accident rates in densely populated areas like Miami and California, and a significant number of accidents occurring under fair weather conditions in the morning. These insights can inform road safety initiatives and policy decisions to reduce accidents and improve public safety.
